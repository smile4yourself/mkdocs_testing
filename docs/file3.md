title: Unified Canvas
---

The Unified Canvas is a tool designed to streamline and simplify the process of
composing an image using Stable Diffusion. It offers artists all of the
available Stable Diffusion generation modes (Text To Image, Image To Image,
Inpainting, and Outpainting) as a single unified workflow. The flexibility of
the tool allows you to tweak and edit image generations, extend images beyond
their initial size, and to create new content in a freeform way both inside and
outside of existing images.

This document explains the basics of using the Unified Canvas, introducing you
to its features and tools one by one. It also describes some of the more
advanced tools available to power users of the Canvas.
