# This is the Documentation Repo for InvokAi

To minimize support, it uses a python package called "mkdocs" to create HTML renders of markdown pages.
This is both good and bad, but once you understand it, it's all good.

It uses the "material" theme because this theme allows for a top header, as well as a left-hand header for navigation.

Unfortunately, the menus can disapear if the browser window is resized too small, so if you don't find the menus, make your browser window larger!
